# GifTastic
This is an app for user to create buttons throught the search.
For example, type "pasta" in the search area and it will create a button on the top with label "Pasta", now click on that button and you will see GIFs created bellow (for this homework I have 10 randomly picked images for one search item).
Images come up still but if you click on them, they start animating. Are you tired of animation then click again, and amimation will stop.
For convinience, images are rated (p, pg, ...).
Several buttons are precreated for dimonstration. The app is Mmobile responsive.

Very small part is in HTML. There is CSS for touchy details. I used Bootstrap framework as well. AJAX is used for calling external APIs from Giphy. Big part of work is done with JavaScript and JQuery. Google Fonts are used too.
